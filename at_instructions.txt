- You can use the at command to schedule jobs.
- For example:
  at <time: eg. 15:32> -f ./<script_name or command>
- at -l can be used to see a list of scheduled commands, i.e., process number time etc.
- atq can also be used to see queue
- to remove the job: atrm <process number>
- this can also be used to remove the job: at -r <process number> 
- For a batch remove you can use: atrm $(atq | cut -f1)
- The at utility is not that common on the wild, cron on the other hand is everywhere. 
  Knowing how at works is valuable still since it allows to schedule one time things easily: stopped 
  a daemon for maintenance? schedule the start command so that it definitely restarts it again 
  even if you forget.
